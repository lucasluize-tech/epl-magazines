## 1. Branch-Aware Admin Magazines Page

### Problem

The admin magazines page (`/admin/magazines`) shows a global list of magazines with no branch context. Since magazines are managed per-branch via `BranchMagazine` subscriptions, the admin page should act as a branch inventory view.

### Design

The server component reads the active branch cookie and queries `BranchMagazine` records for that branch, joining the related `Magazine` data, receipt count (current calendar year, Jan–Dec), and most recent receipt date.

**No branch cookie fallback:** If no active branch cookie is set (e.g., cleared cookies, direct URL), redirect to the login page. The branch cookie is set at login and is required for all branch-aware views.

**Table columns:**

| Name | Cadence | Quantity | Total Issues | Last Received | Next Expected | Status | Notes | Actions |

- **Quantity** — from `BranchMagazine.quantity`
- **Total Issues** — count of `IssueReceipt` for this magazine+branch in the current calendar year (Jan 1 – Dec 31), resets each January
- **Last Received** — most recent `IssueReceipt.receivedDate` for this magazine+branch
- **Next Expected** — computed from last received date + cadence via `computeNextExpectedDate()`
- **Status** — toggle slider (`Switch` component) controlling `BranchMagazine.active` (branch-specific, not the global `Magazine.active`). Deactivating a magazine at one branch does not affect other branches. There is no global deactivation from this view — global magazine management (e.g., discontinuing a title entirely) can be handled by removing it from all branches individually.

**Pagination:** Server-side, 10 rows per page, Previous/Next controls at bottom.

### Create Flow

1. Admin fills form: name, cadence, notes, quantity (default 1)
2. `POST /api/magazines` creates the global magazine record, returns the magazine ID
3. `POST /api/branches/[branchId]/magazines` creates the `BranchMagazine` subscription with the specified quantity
4. If step 3 fails, an error is shown. The global magazine exists but is not subscribed — the admin can retry. No orphan data or integrity issues.

### Edit Flow

Single dialog with two sections:

- **Magazine details** (global): name, cadence, notes → `PUT /api/magazines/[id]`
- **Branch subscription** (branch-specific): quantity, last received date → `PUT /api/branches/[branchId]/magazines/[magazineId]`

Changing last received date inserts a new `IssueReceipt` via `POST /api/magazines/[id]/receipts` with the chosen date, the active `branchId`, the admin's own user ID as `receivedById`, and a system note (e.g., "Manually adjusted by admin"). The system always uses the most recently created receipt as the anchor for next expected date computation.

### Delete Flow

The delete confirmation offers two options:

- **"Remove from this branch"** — `DELETE /api/branches/[branchId]/magazines/[magazineId]` (hard delete of the `BranchMagazine` record, not a soft delete)
- **"Delete magazine entirely"** — `DELETE /api/magazines/[id]` (deletes all `BranchMagazine` records, then all `IssueReceipt` records, then the `Magazine` record — in that order to avoid foreign key constraint violations)

## 2. Toggle Slider Component

### Problem

The active/inactive toggles on both admin pages (magazines and users) use `ToggleLeft`/`ToggleRight` Lucide icons styled as buttons. They look like sliders but have no slider animation — they act as plain buttons.

### Design

Add the shadcn/ui `Switch` component (`npx shadcn@latest add switch`). Replace the icon buttons in both `AdminMagazinesClient` and `AdminUsersClient` with `Switch`. The component provides a proper slider with smooth animation. It fires the toggle API call on click — no intermediate state, optimistic update that reverts on error.

---

## 3. Button Disable Pattern

### Problem

Rapid clicks on action buttons (toggle, edit, delete, create) can fire multiple API calls.

### Design

All action buttons across both admin pages (magazines and users) set `disabled={true}` while their API call is in flight. Re-enabled on success or error response. This includes: toggle switches, edit/save buttons, delete/confirm buttons, and create/submit buttons.

## 4. Branch Selection at Login

### Problem

Users log in without selecting a branch, defaulting to Main. Staff may not realize which branch they're operating in before making changes.

### Design

Add a required branch dropdown to the login page, above the login button. No default is selected — the user must explicitly pick a branch. On successful login, the selected branch is set as the `epl-active-branch` cookie (same mechanism as `BranchSelector`).

**Branch list fetching:** The login page is unauthenticated, so the branch list is fetched server-side in the login page's Server Component (direct Prisma query for active branches) and passed as props to the client form. No unauthenticated API endpoint is needed.

The `BranchSelector` in the sidebar remains available for switching branches after login.

## 5. User Profile Page

### Problem

No user profile page exists. The sidebar user badge (name + role) is not clickable. Users cannot change their own name or password.

### Design

**Sidebar change:** The user badge/name/role section becomes a `<Link href="/profile">` — same visual appearance, clickable with hover effect.

**Route:** `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx`

**Page contents:**

- User info display: name, email (read-only), role (read-only)
- **Change name** form: text input + save button
- **Change password** form: current password, new password, confirm new password + save button
  - **Password validation:** minimum 8 characters. Confirm password mismatch is validated client-side (disable submit until match) and server-side (return 400 if mismatch).

**API route:** `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`

- `PUT` — supports two independent operations in a single request:
  - Name update: `{ name: string }` — updates user name
  - Password update: `{ currentPassword: string, newPassword: string }` — validates current password with bcrypt, enforces minimum 8 characters for new password
  - Both can be sent together: `{ name, currentPassword, newPassword }`. Each field set is validated independently — a valid name update succeeds even if password fields are absent, and vice versa.
- Updates the user record by ID — since `IssueReceipt` links by `receivedById` (foreign key), changing the user's name does not break any logs or receipts

**Audit logging:** Log name changes and password changes (without logging actual password values).

## 6. Audit Log Display

### Problem

The audit log viewer shows raw cuid strings for user IDs, magazine IDs, and branch IDs. These are not human-readable.

### Design

The audit log page resolves IDs to names when rendering:

- User IDs → user names
- Magazine IDs → magazine names
- Branch IDs → branch names

The stored log entries (`logs/audit.log`) continue to use IDs for data integrity. Resolution happens at display time only.

**Performance:** The log page is already paginated (or should be if not). ID resolution is done in bulk — collect all unique IDs from the visible page's entries, then query each entity type once (e.g., one `findMany` for all referenced user IDs). This avoids N+1 queries.

## Technical Notes

- **No schema changes required.** All features use existing Prisma models (`Magazine`, `BranchMagazine`, `IssueReceipt`, `User`, `Branch`).
- **Existing API fix:** `DELETE /api/magazines/[id]` must be updated to also delete `BranchMagazine` records before deleting the magazine (currently only deletes `IssueReceipt` records, which would cause a foreign key error).
- **Existing API fix:** `DELETE /api/branches/[id]/magazines/[magazineId]` currently does a soft delete (`active: false`). Change to hard delete to match the "Remove from this branch" semantics.
- **New shadcn component:** `Switch` (via `npx shadcn@latest add switch`)
- **New routes:** `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx`, `app/api/users/profile/route.ts`
- **Modified routes:** `app/(dashboard)/admin/magazines/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- **Modified components:** `AdminMagazinesClient`, `AdminUsersClient`, `Sidebar`, `CreateMagazineDialog`, `EditMagazineDialog`, login form
