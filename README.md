## 🌟 Highlights

- Track periodical magazine receipts across multiple library branches
- Automatic overdue detection based on each magazine's publication cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, seasonal)
- Dashboard view with at-a-glance status: overdue, expected this week, and upcoming
- Role-based access control — staff mark receipts, admins manage magazines and users
- Admin data reports: Oversight, Accountability, and Operations metrics
- Full audit logging of every meaningful action
- Zero external dependencies beyond the app itself — SQLite database, file-based logs, no third-party services


## ℹ️ Overview

EPL Magazine Tracker is an internal web application built for Edison Public Library staff to manage periodical magazine subscriptions and receipts. When magazines arrive at a branch, staff log the receipt; the system then tracks each title's publication cadence, flags overdue issues, and shows what's expected each week. Admins also have access to data reports covering Oversight, Accountability, and Operations metrics.

The application is designed for internal LAN deployment only via Docker Compose. It uses SQLite for storage (no database server needed), JWT-based session authentication, and file-based audit logging — keeping infrastructure simple and self-contained.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript (`strict: true`) |
| Database | SQLite via Prisma ORM v7 |
| Auth | JWT sessions with jose + bcrypt |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Audit Log | Winston (JSON lines to file) |


## ⬇️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** 9+
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for production deployment)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd epl-magazines

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set SESSION_SECRET:
#   SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Generate Prisma client and run migrations
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This mounts `prisma/` (SQLite database) and `logs/` (audit log) as volumes for persistence. Back up by copying `prisma/dev.db` and `logs/audit.log`.


## 🚀 Usage

1. **Log in** with your credentials at `/login`
2. **Select your branch** from the branch selector in the sidebar
3. **View the dashboard** to see overdue, expected this week, and upcoming magazines
4. **Mark a magazine as received** from the magazines list when it arrives
5. **Admin users** can manage magazines, users, and view the audit log from the admin panel

| Action | Where |
|---|---|
| See what's overdue or expected | Dashboard (`/dashboard`) |
